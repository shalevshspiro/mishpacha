    "title": "Why Are We Here?",
    "text": "In Israel, thousands of children live as orphans. Children who did not choose to be born into a painful silence that tries, in every way, to be filled. We believe that every such child deserves not only to survive, but to truly live – to grow within a community, with emotional support, educational opportunities, and a sense of belonging.\n\nThe Mishpacha Association was established to provide exactly that. We are not a replacement – we are a network of care and support."
